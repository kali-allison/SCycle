Scyle is a parallelized finite difference code that simulates earthquake cycles on a strike-slip fault in 2D. The fault is governed by rate-and-state friction using either the aging or slip law. The coseismic phase can be fully inertial (meaning that wave-propagation is resolved) or quasi-dynamic, while the interseismic phase is assumed to be quasi-dynamic. A number of different rheological choices are supported: elasticity, linear Maxwell viscoelasticity, and power-law viscoelasticity with dislocation creep, diffusion creep, or both operating in parallel. Two strain-weakening mechanisms are supported: grain size reduction, and shear heating.

Several representative examples, including visualization files, can be found in the examples/ folder.
